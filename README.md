# Pipeweave

## Project Goal

I have tried some popular Python data pipeline libraries, and have found them all to be a little hard to use for custom use cases. The goal of this project is to create a pipeline library that avoids some of the common pitfalls and allows users to easily construct pipelines using custom functions and run them using a finite state machine.
